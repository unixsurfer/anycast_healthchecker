Building a Debian package for anycast healthchecker is rather easy. Just follow
the steps below. Building the package from within GIT is not encouraged as some
part of the building system is trying to be smart and does naughty things with
the ChangeLog and AUTHORS file and stuff.

Here you go:

  Create a pristine build dir

    mkdir /tmp/ah-build

  Create a tarball for the latest stable version

    git archive --format tar --prefix=anycast-healthchecker-0.9.8/ HEAD | xz > /tmp/ah-build/anycast-healthchecker_0.9.8.orig.tar.xz

  Extract the tarball and change into the build directory

    cd /tmp/ah-build && tar xf anycast-healthchecker_0.9.8.orig.tar.xz && cd anycast-healthchecker-0.9.8

  Build the package

    dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -rfakeroot

  Enjoy :-)
