Description: Healthchecker for Anycasted services
 anycast-healthchecker monitors a service by doing periodic health checks and
 based on the result instructs Bird daemon to either advertise or withdraw the
 route to reach the monitored service. As a result Bird will only advertise
 routes for healthy services. Routes for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.
 .
 Bird must be configured in a certain way to interface properly with
 anycast-healthchecker.
 .
 anycast-healthchecker is a Python program operated as a native
 systemd service. It uses threading to run multiple service checks in
 parallel.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
