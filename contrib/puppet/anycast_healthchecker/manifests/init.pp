# == Class: anycast_healthchecker
#
# Installs, configures and manages anycast-healthchecker daemon
#
# === Parameters
#
# Document parameters here.
#
# [*bird_conf*]
#   File with the list of IPv6 prefixes allowed to be exported. If this file is
#   a symbolic link then the destination and the link itself must be on the same
#   mounted filesystem.
#
# [*bird6_conf*]
#   File with the list of IPv6 prefixes allowed to be exported. If this file is
#   a symbolic link then the destination and the link itself must be on the same
#   mounted filesystem.
#
# [*bird_variable*]
#   The name of the list defined in ``bird_conf``
#
# [*bird6_variable*]
#   The name of the list defined in ``bird6_conf``
#
# [*bird_reconfigure_cmd*]
#   Command to trigger a reconfiguration of IPv4 Bird daemon
#
# [*bird6_reconfigure_cmd*]
#   Command to trigger a reconfiguration of IPv6 Bird daemon
#
# [*bird_keep_changes*]
#   Keep a history of changes for ``bird_conf`` file by copying it to a directory.
#   During the startup of the daemon a directory with the name ``history`` is
#   created under the directory where ``bird_conf`` file resides. The daemon has to
#   have sufficient privileges to create that directory.
#
# [*bird6_keep_changes*]
#   Keep a history of changes for ``bird6_conf`` file by copying it to a directory.
#   During the startup of the daemon a directory with the name ``history`` is
#   created under the directory where ``bird6_conf`` file resides. The daemon has to
#   have sufficient privileges to create that directory.
#   WARNING: If keep changes is enabled for both IP protocols then the
#   ``bird_conf`` and ``bird6_conf`` **must** point to files which are stored on
#   two different directories.
#
# [*bird_changes_counter*]
#   How many ``bird_conf`` files to keep in the ``history`` directory.
#
# [*bird6_changes_counter*]
#   How many ``bird6_conf`` files to keep in the ``history`` directory.
#
# [*configuration_dir*]
#   Read settings for service checks from files under directory
#
# [*configuration_file*]
#   Read settings for the daemon from
#
# [*group*]
#   Set the UNIX group that anycast-healthchecker is executed.
#   WARNING: Group must exist in the system.
#
# [*http_server*]
#   Server name to send JSON logging over HTTP protocol.
#
# [*http_server_port*]
#   Port to connect
#
# [*http_server_protocol*]
#   HTTP protocol to use, either ``http`` or ``https``
#
# [*http_server_timeout*]
#   How long to wait for the server to send data before giving up, as a float number.
#   JSON messages are send using http POST requests which are executed in blocking
#   mode which means that possible long delays will make the health checks to be
#   delayed as well.
#  ``http_server_timeout`` accepts floating point numbers as values which are
#   passed to underlying request module as a single timeout which will be applied
#   to both the connect and the read timeouts.
#
# [*ipv4*]
#   Enable IPv4 support
#
# [*ipv6*]
#   Enable IPv6 support
#
# [*json_logging*]
#  ``true`` enables JSON logging ``false`` disables it.
#
# [*user*]
#   Set the UNIX user that anycast-healthchecker is executed
#   WARNING: User must exist in the system.
#
# === Examples
#
#    $user  = 'healthchecker'
#    $group = 'healthchecker'
#    $bird_variable  = 'ACAST_PS_ADVERTISE'
#    $bird6_variable = 'ACAST_PS_ADVERTISE_IPV6'
